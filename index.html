This is a opportunity to try out a more modern framework built with many of the lessons of <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span> and <span style="font-family:'Inter'">React</span> in mind. I learned a lot as part of this project.<br><br>First, while I'm not a <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Svelte</span> expert after this experiment, it is easy to see the parallels with <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span>. All the concepts that I'm used to using in <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span> are available in <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Svelte</span>, often with less boilerplate and more standard-based implementations. I really appreciate the simplicity compared to <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span>.<br><br>I also learned that I'm not a designer and I have amazing appreciation for all of the talented designers that I've worked with. This site isn't particularly captivating from a design perspective. I modeled the appearance off of a typical IDE in Dark Mode.

I had just gotten my first Android phone and was excited by the ability to create my own apps. I created a fairly simple app that kept track of repeating scheduled tasks. Rather than setting reminders which would trigger on a set schedule, this app started the clock on the reminder once you performed the task. So, if you are a week late doing a task that should be done every 2 week, it would still remind you 2 weeks later.<br><br>I published the app in the Android Store and experimented with some different delivery mechanisms. First, I simply charged $0.99. Then, I differentiated a 'free' and 'paid' version. Overall, this yielded me a whopping $136.<br><br>Finally, I switched to a free + ads model. This drove a whole $36 in revenue. While I didn't become a millionaire, I had a surprisingly loyal following and lots of 5-star reviews. Unfortunately, over time it became really difficult to support the increasingly fragmented Android device market. Also, my entire family had moved to iPhones and I was the odd person out.<br><br>After switching myself to iPhone, I ported the app to iOS for personal use only. I never published to the App Store based on my previous experience.<br><br>Years after removing my App from the Android App Store, I was still getting contacted from former users. One user requested the source code so that they could recompile for their personal device.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div> </div> </section> <div class="main-scroller svelte-gmj1b8"><div class="outer svelte-1wal2ye"><button class="circle selected svelte-1wal2ye" data-section="Intro"></button><button class="circle  svelte-1wal2ye" data-section="About"></button><button class="circle  svelte-1wal2ye" data-section="Skills"></button><button class="circle  svelte-1wal2ye" data-section="Experience"></button><button class="circle  svelte-1wal2ye" data-section="Projects"></button> </div></div> </div>
